# Couchbase Node.js Client

The Node.js SDK library allows you to connect to a Couchbase cluster from 
Node.js. It is a native Node.js module and uses the very fast libcouchbase 
library to handle communicating to the cluster over the Couchbase binary
protocol.

## This a friendly fork which sometimes contains fixes not yet released in couchnode and latest node prebuilds

It is not supported by Couchbase if you have any specific issues please post them here. Otherwise all documentation of the main version is here: [main repo](https://github.com/couchbase/couchnode)
